## Research Interest

My research interests focus on public-key cryptography with provable security. 

In particular, I am interested in the design of cryptographic schemes

- immune to new types of attacks, including key-dependent message attack (KDM), related-key attack (RKA), key-leakage attack (KLA) and selective-opening attack (SOA);
- enjoying a tight security reduction to computational assumptions;
- based on the intractability of factoring-based (DCR), pairing-based (DDH, DLIN) or lattice (LWE, LPN) problems.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dalenhan/shuaihan.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dalenhan/shuaihan.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
